/**
 * This package provides an interface to a Pololu TIC
 * stepper motor controller.
 * 
 * The TIC interface class finds the tic and manages the
 * connection supporting hotplugging your TIC.  Then there 
 * are enums for the variables, settings and commands that 
 * provide access to these by passing the interface to the 
 * respective methods.
 * 
 * Some shortcut functions exist in the interface to some 
 * commands that are particularly useful.
